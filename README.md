A personal hobby project to learn and understand how reactivity systems work in frontend frameworks, especially Vue.js.

## What is this?

This is my playground for exploring the magic behind reactive programming! I'm building a simple reactivity system from scratch to understand how frameworks like Vue make data reactive and automatically update the UI when it changes.

## Why?

Ever wondered how Vue's `ref()` and `reactive()` work under the hood? Or how the framework knows exactly when to re-render components? This project is my way of diving deep into those concepts and learning by doing.

## What's inside?

Currently exploring:
- **Effects** - The core of reactivity that tracks dependencies and re-runs when data changes
- **Dependency tracking** - How the system knows which effects depend on which data
- **Triggering updates** - How changes in data automatically trigger re-computations

## Getting started

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the dev server
pnpm dev
```

## Learning journey

This is very much a work in progress! I'm documenting my learning process and experimenting with different approaches to understand reactivity patterns.
